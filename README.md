# Bank Account Simulation (Java)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This is my solution for **Task 5: Bank Account Simulation** given in the Java Developer Internship.
It is a **console-based banking system** to simulate real-world bank operations.

## âœ… What I Have Done

* Created an **Account class** with fields (Account Holder, Balance, Transaction History).
* Implemented **deposit()** and **withdraw()** methods.
* Used **ArrayList** to store transaction history dynamically.
* Developed **SavingsAccount** (with interest) and **CurrentAccount** (with overdraft) using **Inheritance**.
* Added **method overriding** for `withdraw()` in CurrentAccount.
* Developed a **menu-driven system** for Deposit, Withdraw, Balance, History, Exit.
* Added **input validation** for invalid amounts and overdraft conditions.
* Displayed **clear error messages** for invalid transactions.
* Wrote a **README.md** to explain project structure and usage.
