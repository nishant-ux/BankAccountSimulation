# Bank Account Simulation (Java)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This is my solution for **Task 5: Bank Account Simulation** given in the Java Developer Internship.
It is a **console-based banking system** that simulates real-world account operations like deposit, withdraw, and viewing transaction history.

## âœ… What I Have Done

* Created an **Account class** with fields (Account Holder, Balance, Transaction History).
* Implemented **deposit()** and **withdraw()** methods.
* Used **ArrayList** to maintain transaction history dynamically.
* Added **SavingsAccount** (with interest feature) and **CurrentAccount** (with overdraft limit) by using **Inheritance**.
* Demonstrated **method overriding** in `withdraw()` for CurrentAccount.
* Developed a **menu-driven system** for Deposit, Withdraw, Balance Check, Transaction History, Exit.
* Added **input validation** for invalid amounts, insufficient balance, and overdraft limit.
* Displayed **clear error messages** for invalid transactions.
* Wrote a **README.md** to explain project structure and usage.

## ðŸ›  Concepts Used

* **Classes & Objects**
* **Inheritance** (SavingsAccount & CurrentAccount extend Account)
* **Method Overriding** (`withdraw()` in CurrentAccount)
* **Encapsulation** (private/protected fields)
* **ArrayList** for transaction history
* **Menu-driven program with exception handling & input validation**
